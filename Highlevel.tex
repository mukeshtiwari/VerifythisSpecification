\section{Abstracting the implementation detail}

\subsection{Abstract Data Type}
\begin{verbatim}
KeyId : Type (* Abstract Type *)
Fingerprint : Type (* Abstract Type *)
Identity : Type (* Abstract Type *)
Token : Type (* Abstract Type *)
(* Key is record data type *)
Key : Type = Record {
  keyId : KeyId
  fingerprint : Fingerprint
  identities : Identity set} 

\end{verbatim}

I am slightly confused between \textbf{sealed trait} and
\textbf{case class}
\begin{itemize}
\item case class Identity(email: String)
\item case class Token(uuid: UUID)
\end{itemize}  


\subsection{Maps as Function Type}
\begin{verbatim}
keys : Fingerprint -> Key
uploaded : UToken -> Fingerprint
pending : VToken -> (Fingerprint, Identity)
confirmed : Identity -> Fingerprint
managed : MToken -> Fingerprint
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Function Definition}
